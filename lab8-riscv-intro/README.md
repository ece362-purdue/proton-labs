# Lab 8

> [!NOTE]
> Changes in format from previous lab:  
> For this lab and other assembly labs going forward, the lab manual will be separated from the lab code.  This repository is the lab manual, and will contain the instructions.  
> 
> The lab code repository will be the repository you accept from GitHub Classroom.  You can find the classroom assignment link in the Brightspace or Piazza post pertaining to this lab - this will allow you to fork the lab code repository so you can work on it and submit it separately from the lab manual.

Lab 8 is split into two parts - one to get you set up, and the other containing the actual lab.

1. [Infrastructure setup](./lab80.md)
2. [Introductory RISC-V Assembly](./lab81.md)

Do not forget to commit and push your changes to GitHub after completing the setup portion, and after completing each step of the RISC-V Assembly portion.
