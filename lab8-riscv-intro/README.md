# Lab 8

> [!NOTE]
> Changes in format from previous lab:  
> You are now entering the assembly labs.  To do these labs, we will be simulating RISC-V assembly on `eceprog`, so you no longer have to use your microcontroller going forward.  Once you have finished your embedded lab practical, you may use your breadboard for the course project.
>
> The lab code repository will continue to be the repository you accept from GitHub Classroom.  You can find the classroom assignment link in the Brightspace or Piazza post pertaining to this lab - this will allow you to fork the lab code repository so you can work on it and submit it separately from the lab manual.

Lab 8 is split into two parts - one to get you set up, and the other containing the actual lab.

1. [Infrastructure setup](./lab80.md)
2. [Introductory RISC-V Assembly](./lab81.md)

Do not forget to commit and push your changes to GitHub after completing the setup portion, and after completing each step of the RISC-V Assembly portion.
