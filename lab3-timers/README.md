### Instructional Objectives

- To understand the clock tree of the Pico 2 and how to use it to generate accurate timing.
- To understand how to use the GPIO pins and a timer to interface with a keypad.
- To understand how to use the GPIO pins and a timer to interface with eight multiplexed 7-segment displays.

### Step 0.1: Set up your environment

Make sure to clone the code repository from GitHub Classroom.  Keep in mind to add, commit and push any changes you make so that your work is accessible from a lab machine. 

Open the template in VScode and with your Debug Probe connected to your Proton, click "Upload and Monitor".  Open the Serial Monitor to see the output of your program, and press the Reset button so that it prints out again.  You should now see the following:

```text

```

You can then type `help` to learn what commands you can use to test a certain subroutine.  You will use this to demo your implementation and wiring to the TAs.

If the text doesn't appear when you click "Upload and Monitor", ensure that `autotest()` is uncommented in `main.c`.

### Step 0.2: Wire and organize your breadboard

In this lab, we're going to add the 7-segment parallel driver card that is in your kit.  This was designed for you by your instructor to help alleviate wiring issues in the past from when students wired this up themselves on the breadboard, and to create space for new components in the future.  The schematic for this card is shown below, but **do not wire this up!**  We have a lot of background to get through first as to how this works:

![7seg](7seg.png)

The eight TDCR1050M seven-segment displays should be familiar to you from ECE 270 - you had these on the FPGA board that you used.  However, unlike 270, you will not directly drive each individual pin on the display - that would require 64 I/O pins that we do not have!  

![tdcr1050m-schema](tdcr1050m-schem.png)

Instead, we introduce a 74HC138 (another chip familiar to you from 270) 3-to-8 active-low decoder, whose outputs are all high except for the one specified by the three select pins.  

We also introduce a TLC59211PWR chip, which is called a sink driver.  The sink driver has eight outputs, each one connected to the cathode of the segments or decimal points on each seven-segment display.  A sink driver is a device that is capable of sinking (connecting to ground) a connection with a large current flow. 47Î© limiting resistors will be placed in between the sink driver and each cathode to prevent too much current from flowing through each segment.  Conveniently, the sink driver will sink current through an output pin when its corresponding input pin is high. In this way, it acts as an open-drain inverter, since a sink driver cannot push an output pin high. Using the sink driver, a logic high applied to the driver will cause the particular segment to illuminate, which is how you would like to think about it. 

![sink-driver-app](sink-driver-app.png)

The BJTs in the middle of the decoder and sink driver chips, and the seven-segment displays provide power to the common anode of each of the displays, but only if the corresponding Base pin is turned off to allow current to flow from the Emitter through to the Collector pin.  Note that all Base pins are connected to the outputs of the 74HC138 decoder - this is how we can control which display is active at any given time.

Therefore, the decoder controls **which display we want to turn on**, and the sink driver controls **the segments and decimal point of the selected display**.  At any given time, only one display can be turned on and have its segments lit up.  This concept of selecting which display to turn on is also called **multiplexing**.

Thus, we've reduced the need for 64 I/O pins to 3 select pins of the 74HC138, and 8 pins of the TLC59211PWR, for a total of 11 I/O pins.  This is a much more manageable number of pins to control the displays... until you look at the Pico 2, and you wonder how you're going to do future labs with what you have left!  That means we need to add one more level of abstraction to the display control - shift registers.

Recall from ECE 270 that a **shift register** is a set of flip-flops that are connected in series, so that when a rising edge of the common clock occurs, the values of the flip-flops appear to **shift** by 1 to the left.  

If we combine the 11 pins on the seven-segment displays as **bits**, we get an 11-bit value.  If we use a shift register to contain these 11 bits, we can control the display with only 3 pins - a **data pin**, a **clock pin**, and an **enable pin**.  The data pin is used to set the value of the 11 bits, the clock pin is used to shift the bits into the shift register, and the enable pin is used to allow the shift register to *shift*.  This is how we can control the display with only 3 pins.

In your lab kit, you have two 74HC595 shift registers, which are 8-bit shift registers with enables.  You can cascade them together to create a 16-bit shift register, which is enough to control the 11 bits of the seven-segment displays.  The pins QH-QA together form the 8-bit output of the shift register (with QH being MSB and QA being LSB), and on every rising edge of SRCLK, the bit on SER is shifted into QA, with all other bits being shifted into the next bit (QA goes to QB, QB goes to QC, etc).  In our case, the bit getting shifted out of the last bit (QH) of one shift register, goes into the first bit (QA) on the other shift register. 

**Use the diagram below** to wire up the two shift registers between the parallel driver card and the Pico 2 pins GP13-GP15:

![sr](sr.png)

Our suggested placement is to put the parallel driver card on the **top left** of the board, and the shift registers on the breadboard panel directly below the parallel driver card.  Make sure to flip the chips so that pin 1 of both registers is facing the 7-segment driver card, so that most wires don't have to cross over the chip to reach the card.

**Note the seemingly random connections between QA-QH to the D8-D1 pins** of your parallel driver card - this is a mistake on the card that carried over from prior versions of these labs, when students used to manually wire up the displays, 74HC138, and TLC59211 chips.  While the wiring may seem tedious to do, this is to allow you to assign segments DP-G-F-E-D-C-B-A, in that order, to the 8 bits of the rightmost shift register.  The 3 select lines SEL2,SEL1,SEL0 form the bottom 3 bits of the left shift register, allowing you to easily concatenate the values as a single 11-bit value `{SEL2,SEL1,SEL0,D8,D7,D6,D5,D4,D3,D2,D1}`.  

Therefore, to control the display, we'll pad the 11-bit value with 5 zeroes to create a 16-bit value, which we will "clock in" to the shift registers using GP13-GP15.  (This should be familiar from 270 - we're just doing it in C, and not Verilog, now!)

Now that you understand the background, go ahead and do the following:

1. Place the parallel driver card on the top left of your breadboard.
2. Place the two 74HC595 shift registers on the breadboard panel directly below the parallel driver card.
3. Connect the parallel driver card to the shift registers as shown in the diagram above.  (The wiring will get a little bit messy, but that's okay.  Expect messy wiring sometimes with more complex components!)
4. Wire the shift registers up to power and ground where needed.
5. Connect the shift registers to your Pico 2 at the corresponding pins.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run `check_wiring` in the autotest console to check your wiring.  If you have any issues, carefully check your wiring and identify missing power/ground connections, or miswired connections.

### Step 1: Read the datasheet

Now that we're all wired up, let's get started understanding how clocks work on the Pico 2.

*Clocks?  I thought this was about timers?*

Yes, but you have no way of running *anything*, much less timers, without clocks.  Microcontrollers generally implement a **clock tree**, which is a set of clock sources and dividers that allow you to generate a wide variety of clock frequencies for different peripherals.  The Pico 2 is no exception.

![clock-tree](clock-tree.png)

The source clocks that the Pico 2 can use can be identified on the left side of the diagram above:
- GPCLK0-1: These are GPIO pins that you can use as clock inputs or outputs on your Pico 2.
    - This is very useful for prototyping.  You can use a function generator to generate a clock signal, and then use it to test your code on a custom board with the RP2350 chip, if you choose to make one for senior design.
- USB PLL: PLLs, or **phase-locked loops**, are a useful type of circuit that multiply/divide that frequency of an input clock by a certain factor.  In the case of the USB PLL, it takes the 12 MHz crystal oscillator as an input, and multiplies it by 4 to get a 48 MHz clock.
- System PLL: This PLL *effectively* multiples the 12 MHz crystal oscillator by 125 (due to the VCO, Voltage-Controlled Oscillator), and then divides by 10, to get a 150 MHz clock.
    - Your CPU cores will use this clock frequency while executing the instructions from your code.
- Crystal Oscillator (XOSC): This is a 12 MHz crystal oscillator that is used as a reference clock for the PLLs, and can also be used directly as a reference clock for the onboard peripherals.
- Low Power Oscillator (LPOSC): This is a 32 kHz oscillator that is used for low-power or low-frequency applications.  Typically, you want to make this as accurate as possible, so a 32.768 kHz crystal would be more ideal.

From these various **clock sources**, we derive the following clocks for use by peripherals:
- `clk_gpout0-3`: These are the clocks that are output on the GPCLK0-3 pins.  You can use these to drive external peripherals, or to test your code on a custom board.
- `clk_adc`: This is the clock that the ADC peripheral uses to sample the analog input pins.  Typically, it is the 48 MHz clock from the USB PLL, but it can be divided down to a lower frequency if needed.
- `clk_sys`: This is the 150 MHz clock that the CPU cores use to execute instructions.
- `clk_peri`: This can be anywhere between 12-150 MHz, and is used by the peripherals on the Pico 2. 
- `clk_hstx`: This is the clock that the High-Speed Serial Transmit peripheral uses to transmit data over GPIO pins at a high data rate.  It is typically 150 MHz.
- `clk_ref`: This is the reference clock that the PLLs use to generate their output clocks, that go to **timers**.  It is typically the 12 MHz crystal oscillator.
- `tick`: This is a 1 MHz clock that is used by the AON timer to generate their own clock signals.  You used this last lab as a prescaled (12 MHz -> 1 MHz) clock input to the RISC-V Platform Timer.
- `clk_pow`: This is the clock that the power management unit uses to manage the power states of the Pico 2.  It is typically 32 kHz from the LPOSC.

Read [Section 8.1: Clock Overview](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A512%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C115%2C709.282%2Cnull%5D) for more details.

Now, for the timers.  On the Pico 2, we have the following ones:

1. RISC-V Platform Timer: It is a 64-bit timer whose value is accessible through `MTIME`, and is compared against `MTIMECMP` to generate an interrupt.  By default, it uses the `tick` clock as a prescaled input to generate its own clock signal.

2. Always-on (AON) Timer: This is a 32-bit timer that is always on regardless of power states, and is connected to the LPOSC to save power.  Since it is always on, it is useful for generating interrupts at a very low frequency, such as once per second, to check if the Pico 2 should wake up from a low-power state.  We'll leave this alone for now, but you can read [Section 12.10](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A1194%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C115%2C250.994%2Cnull%5D) in the datasheet.

3. Watchdog Timer: This is a 32-bit timer that is used to reset the Pico 2 if it gets stuck in a loop or otherwise becomes unresponsive.  We'll leave this alone for now, but you can read [Section 12.9](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A1190%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C115%2C585.608%2Cnull%5D) in the datasheet.

4. SysTick Timers: This is a 24-bit timer that also counts from either the `tick` signal or the system reference clock.  This would be considered the "ARM Platform Timer", but since it is not usable by the RISC-V cores, and because it has far less bits to count, we won't use them (although you are encouraged to use these when you use the ARM cores if you need more timers).  [Section 3.7 - Cortex-M33](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A125%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C115%2C339.11468%2Cnull%5D) describes the SysTick timer as part of the ARM specification, and in more detail.  

4. System Timers: These are two 64-bit timers (TIMER0 and TIMER1) that are used to generate **alarms** at a certain frequency (just consider them interrupts).  They are connected to the `tick` clock by default (which is at 1 MHz assuming a cycle count of 12), with an option to change to the system clock source.

The system timers can be considered **general-purpose timers**, because the interrupts that they generate can be used to run any type of custom handlers that you provide.  However, unlike the Platform Timer, there are up to 4 alarms that can be set on each timer, and each alarm can be set to generate an interrupt at a certain frequency.  

An alarm triggers when the configured counter value for that alarm is reached by the timer's own counter, which increments with every rising edge of its clock source.  Therefore, you need to set the alarm counter value to a sum of the **current** timer value and the number of *ticks* you want to wait before the alarm triggers.  

Read [Section 12.8 - System Timers](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/rp2350/rp2350-datasheet.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A1179%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C115%2C302.622%2Cnull%5D) and answer the following questions:

1. What is the default **clock source** for timers TIMER0 and TIMER1? (i.e. what is the input clock to the tick generator?)

2. What are the three steps to enable an alarm on a particular timer?  What line of code would you write to clear/set a bit for the first step?

3. What needs to be done to clear a latched interrupt (i.e. acknowledge a timer interrupt) so that it does not fire again?

4. What is the furthest point in time, in minutes, that the alarms can be set to generate an interrupt?

> Avoid the urge to ask others (AI/LLMs are included in "others") for answers.  These questions are specifically designed to get you used to looking at the datasheet for information, and for *you* to understand the microcontroller's specific configuration.

### Step 2: Use the multiplexed display

Now that you understand the clock tree and the timers, let's get started on the display.  We understand that to display on any given digit of the display, we need to push out an 11-bit value to the shift registers, of which:

1. The top three bits are the select lines for the 74HC138 3-to-8 decoder to select one of the eight digits, and;
2. The bottom eight bits are the decimal point and segments of the chosen digit display.

To see the multiplexing effect in real time, run `check_wiring` on the autotest object you were provided.  The way it works is by quickly pushing out eight 11-bit values successively, with a delay in between each value to ensure the digit is lit for long enough that you can see it.  

Implement the functions as follows to achieve this effect.

### 2.1 - `print_7seg`

In this function, implement the data transmission to the 11 pins of your seven-segment card so that it displays the currently selected digit, using `msg_idx` contained in the global array `message`, which is 8 characters long.  By default, `message` is initialized to display "01234567" on the 8 seven segment displays.

The idea is that you will call `print_7seg` in a loop, incrementing the index to 7 and wrapping back around to 0, which will give the appearance of a static display.  The function will be called in a timer interrupt handler, which will be set to fire every 1 ms.

The general algorithm is as follows:

```c
void print_7seg() {
    // clear the enable GPIO pin
    // for each of the bits 11 through 0 of message[msg_idx], starting from the MSB:
    //     set the data GPIO pin to the selected bit
    //     set the clock GPIO pin high
    //     WAIT 1 us (if you use sleep_us, you'll get an error.  Use a similar function.)
    //     set the clock GPIO pin low
    //     WAIT 1 us (if you use sleep_us, you'll get an error.  Use a similar function.)
    // set the enable GPIO pin high
    // if msg_idx == 7, set it to 0, 
    //    else increment msg_idx (how to do this without if/else? hint: AND operator)
}
```

This concept of setting the data high, before *clocking* it in, is very important, and we'll see it again in a future lab with a peripheral that can do this for us automatically.  Right now, we're doing it manually, which is also called **bit-banging**.  We do this for every "digit" in `message`, each of which is 11 bits long (3 bits for the decoder + 8 bits for the seven-segment display).

To test this, initialize GP13-GP15 as outputs, and call `print_7seg` in an infinite loop in `main`.  You should now see your seven-segment displays light up with the characters "01234567" in sequence.  If you don't, check your wiring with the autotest's `check_wiring`, and recheck your implementation of `print_7seg`.

### 2.2 - `init_7seg_timer` and `seg7_timer_isr`

Now, instead of doing it in a loop, we can use a **timer** to let the CPU know when to call `print_7seg`.  This introduces a short delay of 1 millisecond in between each call, which doesn't produce much of a difference on the display, but it gives the CPU a **lot** more time to execute other instructions in between calls.

Implement `init_7seg_timer` so that it:

1. Initializes GP13-GP15 as outputs as you did in `main` (which you can now remove).
2. Configures TIMER0 to generate an interrupt on ALARM0 every 1 ms.
    - Keep in mind the clock frequency for the **timer** as opposed to the entire microcontroller, and how to therefore set the timer's counter value to generate an interrupt every 1 millisecond (0.001 seconds or 1 KHz).
    - Look at the code sample under System Timers > Programmer's Model to understand how to do this.  **Take note of the specific registers used to enable the interrupt, and to set the counter value at which the alarm should trigger.**
3. Enable the interrupt on ALARM0.

Implement `seg7_timer_isr` so that it calls `print_7seg` in the interrupt handler.  This will allow the display to cycle through the characters in `message` every 1 ms.  (If you find hints to add anything else, don't add them just yet - only call `print_7seg` for now.)

Now, call `init_7seg_timer` in main.  It should be the only other function running alongside the `print_7seg` function.  If you see the display cycling through the characters in `message`, it may seem that you successfully displayed the numbers... but there is more than meets the eye here!

To demonstrate our point, we're going to try lighting up each of the decimal points on each digit every 0.25 seconds.  After the `init_7seg_timer` call in `main`, add this code:

```c
int i = 0;
for(;;) {
    message[i] |= 0x80;
    sleep_ms(250);
    message[i++] &= ~0x80;
    i &= 7;
}
```

This turns on a specific digit's decimal point, sleeps 250 ms, then clears it and immediately sets the next one (hence the `i++`).  The sleep creates some time for the timer to take over and cycle through the display, but now that we're modifying `message` in `main`, we should expect that the `print_7seg` function will pick up that change and show the lit decimal point.

However, when we flash it, we'll see something interesting - only the decimal point of the leftmost display lights up, and the rest of the decimal points remain blank.  Time to debug!

When we enter the debugger, let the program continue operation, wait a few seconds, and then press Pause.  You'll see that we'll be paused inside `print_7seg` as called by the interrupt handler:

![call-stack](call-stack.png)

Try setting some breakpoints in `main`, or running and clicking Pause multiple times - all signs will point to the problem that your microcontroller is currently stuck in the interrupt handler, and not returning to `main` to pick up the changes to `message`.  

This is an example of the need (in some cases) to **acknowledge** the interrupt.  In this case, the interrupt is latched, and the CPU will not return to `main` until the interrupt is acknowledged and will continually keep calling `print_7seg`.  To acknowledge the interrupt, you will need to write a 1 to the appropriate bit in a certain register (covered just above Programmer's Model in System Timers in the datasheet.)  Do that **first** in the interrupt handler, and then call `print_7seg`.  Save your changes, and flash the program again.

However, we now see a **second** problem!  The display will no longer cycle through the digits - only 0 (zero) and it's decimal point are lit up.  Debug this again, and you should now see that while the interrupt is being acknowledged the first time, it is not being acknowledged the second time... almost like the interrupt handler is not being called at all, compared to the previous issue where the handler was being called constantly.

This took us a while to figure out, and it is because the Pico 2 by default does not automatically create a **repeating timer**, as per their documentation.  There is a function `add_repeating_timer_ms` as part of the SDK, but for simplicity's sake, and because we want you to take charge of your own code where possible, we can just manually reset the timer in the interrupt handler.  

To fix this, copy in the portion of code where you configured TIMER0 to trigger ALARM0 every 1 ms into `seg7_timer_isr` after acknowledging the interrupt and calling `print_7seg`.  This will reset the timer to trigger the interrupt again in 1 ms, and will allow the display to cycle through the characters in `message` every 1 ms.

We should finally see **01234567** on the display, with the decimal point appearing to shift through each digit every 0.25 seconds.  If you see this, you have successfully implemented code to show numbers on all seven-segment displays at once!

### Step 3: Implement keypad scanning

Now, let's get started on the keypad scanning.  You've already scanned the keypad in lab 1 (If you haven't wired this up, go back to lab 1), but in that lab, we implemented the scanning code in the `main` loop of the program, with delays in between each scan.  This is not ideal, because we could be using the CPU for other computationally-intensive tasks.

Therefore, for this step, we'll use a timer to periodically scan the keypad instead, and interrupt the CPU when it has to scan next, instead of continually waiting on a key.  

The gist of what we're going to do is:
- Create small functions that achieve one thing individually, like driving the column, reading the rows, and registering the pressed key.
- Utilize a 16-bit by 16 keys FIFO structure to maintain history of whether a key was pressed, how long it was pressed, and at what point it was released.
    - Buttons, as you may have noticed in lab 1, add a lot of electrical *bounce* by nature of their construction.  When you press and release a button, the resulting "bounce" can register as multiple presses and releases in a very short time, which isn't ideal.
    - Maintaining a **history** buffer for each of the 16 keys allows us to filter out these bounces.  
- Display each press and release of a button on the seven-segment displays, based on the aforementioned history buffer.

### 3.1 - `drive_column`: Update the keypad column being scanned

Implement the function `drive_column(int c)` that updates the column of the keypad that has a logic high applied to it.  You'll want to use the `gpio_set` and `gpio_clr` **registers** (not SDK function calls) under the SIO subsystem to set or clear multiple pins at once, instead of writing a loop which wastes valuable CPU time.  

```C
void drive_column(int c) {
    c = least 2 bits of c (use AND operator) (why?)
    first clear the COL4-COL1 pins
    then set ONE of the COL4-COL1 pins corresponding to the column `c`
}
```

**The keypad columns are scanned from right-to-left, where the rightmost column is COL1 and the leftmost column is COL4. Rows are interpreted from top-to-bottom.**

### 3.2 - `read_rows`: Read the row values

Once the column is driven, we need to identify what button was pressed by looking at the rows.

Implement the following function to examine the **GPIO input register** and return the 4-bit reading of the row pins of the keypad.  Make sure to **shift** the value appropriately - the permitted range of values from this function must be between 0b0000 and 0b1111, inclusive.

```C
int read_rows() {
    return the 4-bit reading of the row GPIO pins
}
```

### 3.3 - `update_history`: Track what key was pressed up to 8 scans

A 16-element, 8-bit buffer called `hist` has been defined for you in `support.c`.  The purpose of `update_history` is to shift in a 1 when a key press is detected, and 0 when the key is no longer pressed.  We derive that information from `c`, which is the currently driven column, and `rows`, which is the result returned from `read_rows`.  Both of these will be passed as arguments to `update_history`.

In this function, you need to update `hist` at indices as specified by `c` and `rows`.  Therefore, for any digit that was pressed, you need to shift in a 1 into `hist[4*(col)+(row)]` where `col` and `row` correspond to that digit, and shift in zeroes for all other buttons on that column that were NOT pressed.  Shifting in a value requires that you shift the existing value to the left by 1, and then OR the new value into the least significant bit.  

```

For example for digit 5, you should shift a 1 into `hist[4*2+2]`, and a 0 into `hist[4*2+3]` for "2", `hist[4*2+1]` for "8", and `hist[4*2+0]` for "0".  Do this with a for loop that iterates over the 4 rows, and shifts in the value of the row into the appropriate index of `hist`.

Next, we need to identify whether a button has been just pressed, or just let go.  The purpose of **shifting** in ones and zeroes is so that we can identify proper button presses instead of bounce as a result of releasing a button.  We maintain up to 8 scans by shifting in a 1 into an 8-bit element for each key, and so we will only check for two cases for the checked `hist` element:

- If its value is 0x01, then the button was just pressed.
    - In that case, use `push_queue` to push the value `0x80` ORed with `keymap[4*col+row]` (where `col` and `row` correspond to the button being checked).  This generates the seven-segment representation of the button being pressed, and pushes it into the queue.
    - ORing `0x80` should be familiar from the previous step - you OR in this value to turn on the decimal point of the seven-segment display that this digit will be displayed on.
- If its value is 0xfe, then the button was just released after being held down.
    - In that case, push the value `keymap[4*col+row]` only into the queue using `push_queue`.  This generates the seven-segment representation of the button being released, and pushes it into the queue, with the decimal point turned off to indicate a key release.

**The keypad columns are scanned from right-to-left, where the rightmost column is COL1 (index 0) and the leftmost column is COL4 (index 3). Rows are interpreted from top-to-bottom.**

This part can be a little confusing to get.  What it comes down to is that the value of "rows" is **not** just the index of the row.  You need to find the relationship between them, so consider what "rows" is indicating here.  

One hint: Think about what the `read_rows` function returns.  How does the value returned determine what row is being asserted?  What happens if no buttons were pressed?

### 3.4 - `init_keypad_timer` and `keypad_timer_isr`

Implement `init_keypad_timer` to: 

1. Configure GP2-GP5 as outputs, and GP6-GP9 as inputs.
2. Configure TIMER1 to generate an interrupt on ALARM0 every 10 ms.  
    - When the interrupt signal fires, it should invoke `keypad_timer_isr`.

In `keypad_timer_isr`, add the following:

```c
// TODO: acknowledge the interrupt for ALARM1 on TIMER1
int rows = read_rows();
update_history(col, rows);
col = (col + 1) & 3;
drive_column(col);
// TODO: reset the timer's counter
```

Then in `main`, after adding `init_keypad_timer`, call `show_keys`.  This function waits for a key press to occur by checking a queue every time an interrupt fires, and then displays the key press/release on the seven-segment displays by shifting it into `message`.  

Now that you've written all these functions, it's important to go through the added backend code that is helping you with the scanning:

- In an infinite loop, `show_keys` will call `get_key_event`.
- `get_key_event` will execute the `wfi` instruction, which will cause the CPU to sleep until an interrupt occurs.
- When an interrupt occurs and the waking ISR has been executed, control flow will return to the line just after the `wfi` instruction.  If anything has been added to the queue by then as a result of a key press/release, it will be **popped**, and returned to `show_keys`
    - When you use `push_queue`, you are storing the 8-bit 7-segment+DP representation into a 2-element queue.  
    - The value being popped is the one you pushed via this function from `update_history`.
- `show_keys` will then shift in the value of the key press/release into `message`, and then call `print` to write the value into the global `message` array.
- Roughly 1 ms later, `print_7seg` will be called by TIMER0's interrupt handler, and the value of `message` will be displayed on the seven-segment displays.

Run your code on your microcontroller, and you should first see "01234567" before pressing any keys.  `show_keys` will be waiting for a button press, so go ahead and press "9" (do not release it!) on the keypad.  You should see "9" with the decimal point displayed on the rightmost seven-segment display, where it was shifted in.  Release "9", and a second "9" will appear on the display with the decimal point turned off.  If you see this, you have successfully implemented code to scan the keypad and display the pressed keys on the seven-segment displays!

You'll notice that you have to slowly press and release the buttons to make sure that it catches the released button.  This is because the keypad is being scanned every 10 ms, and the key press/release has to be detected within that time frame.  Think about what you could do to improve on that.

### Step 4: (Optional) Play a game

That was a long lab, so you deserve a game after all that hard work!  

Remove `show_keys`, and replace it with `game()` in `main`, after `init_keypad_timer`, and you'll be able to play a game that may be familiar to you from ECE 27000.  As a reminder:

- Your lunar lander starts at 4500 ft above the moon with 800 units of gas.
- Press A for altitude, B for velocity, C for gas, and D to view thrust.  0-9 changes thrust.
- The lander immediately starts picking up speed due to gravity, so its velocity will decrease (entering negative values) as it falls.
- Press "0" to let it pick up a velocity of around -100 ft/s, then press "5".
- Wait until altitude reaches 1800 ft to set the thrust to 9 to counteract the velocity.
- Wait until the velocity reaches -10 ft/s, then press "5", and wait until the altitude reaches 0 to safely land (which will say "LANDED").

Keep in mind that button presses will be registered very slowly since it is in the same interrupt handler as the quantity updation, so be patient!

### Step 5: Confirm your checkoffs before leaving

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure you got checked off here: https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece362/checkoff/
> 
> Make sure to upload your confirmation code and verify that it is accepted by Gradescope.  You will know it is accepted if you get the points from Gradescope.
> 
> Before you leave, make sure your station is clean and that you have gathered your belongings, and then call a TA to confirm that you can leave.  Confirm that you have received your checkoffs and that your confirmation code was accepted on Gradescope before logging out and leaving for the day.
